# software-implementation-of-ZUC-256
Use C language to make ZUC-256 encryption algorithm come true
we use three text files to storage the secret keys, vector quantities and message.
m.txt -> message
key.txt -> secret keys
iv.txt -> vector quantities

the users can change the "main.c" code to change the name of the data storage files.
